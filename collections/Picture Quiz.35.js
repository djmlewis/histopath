Initially, lesions in the lymphatic system are in the regional lymph nodes (e.g., the tracheobronchial lymph nodes in the case of pulmonary tuberculosis), but once tuberculosis is disseminated, for example, by trafficking macrophages, lymph nodes throughout the body will have lesions. Mycobacterium bovis lesions in lymph nodes are characterized by the formation of caseating granulomas. These are often multiple.","languages":"mono","orient":"l","imagePathRotated":"cardsets/central/rotated/macroslide tbln p1a.jpg","imageNamesOrientsArray":["macroslide tbln p1a\tl"]},"macroslide ulcvent p1a":{"name":"macroslide ulcvent p1a","title":"Ulcus ventriculi (gastric ulcer)","cardsetName":"Picture Quiz","cardsetTitle":"Picture Quiz","imagesDirectory":"central","chapterTitle":"Macroscopic","uniqueCardID":"Picture Quiz\tMacroscopic\tmacroslide ulcvent p1a","imageType":".jpg","imagePath":"cardsets/central/fronts/","thumbsPath":"cardsets/central/thumbs/macroslide ulcvent p1a.png","answersText":"Grouping\tDigestive Tract\nDiagnosis\tUlcus ventriculi (gastric ulcer)\nText 1\tNone\nText 2\t• The stomach contains a large volume of clotted and unclotted blood from a gastric ulcer <br>• Theories abound as to the causes of most gastric ulcers in animals.
